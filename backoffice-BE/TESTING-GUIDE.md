# Email Endpoints Testing Guide

## Quick Setup
1. Replace `your_dojo_tag_here` with an actual dojo_tag from your database
2. Replace test email addresses with your own email to receive test emails
3. Make sure your server is running on `http://localhost:5000`

## ⏰ Time Format Support
The API now supports **both** time formats:
- **12-hour format**: `"10:00 AM"`, `"2:30 PM"` ✅ (Recommended - easier to read)
- **24-hour format**: `"10:00:00"`, `"14:30:00"` ✅ (Also works)

The system automatically converts 12-hour format to 24-hour for database storage, and converts back to 12-hour format for email display!

## Testing Workflow (Recommended Order)

### Test 1: Complete Physical Appointment Flow
1. **Test basic email** → Test endpoint #1
2. **Create physical request** → Use endpoint #2 (note the `id`)
3. **Schedule it** → Use endpoint #4 (use `id` from step 2 as `consultation_request_id`)
4. **Reschedule it** → Use endpoint #7 (use `id` from step 3 as `appointment_id`)
5. **Cancel it** → Use endpoint #6 (use same `appointment_id`)

### Test 2: Complete Online Appointment Flow
1. **Create online request** → Use endpoint #3 (note the `id`)
2. **Schedule it** → Use endpoint #5 (use `id` from step 1 as `consultation_request_id`)
3. **Reschedule it** → Use endpoint #8 (use `id` from step 2 as `appointment_id`)
4. **Cancel it** → Use endpoint #6 (use same `appointment_id`)

### Test 3: Trial Class Booking
1. **Create trial class booking** → Use endpoint #9
2. **Check email** → Should receive booking confirmation with class details

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Before Testing:**
- Replace `your_dojo_tag_here` with an actual dojo_tag from your database
- Replace `your-email@example.com` with your real email address
- Make sure you have a dojo in your database with the tag you're using

⏰ **Time Format Tips:**
- Use 12-hour format: `"10:00 AM"`, `"2:30 PM"`, `"11:45 PM"` (easier to read)
- Or 24-hour format: `"10:00:00"`, `"14:30:00"`, `"23:45:00"` (also works)
- The system handles conversion automatically!
- Emails will always show times in friendly 12-hour format

🔍 **After Each Request:**
- Check your email inbox for the email
- Check the server console logs for confirmation messages like `📧 Appointment email sent to...`
- Note down the `id` values from responses for subsequent tests

❌ **If Emails Don't Arrive:**
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify Zoho credentials in `app.js` are correct
3. Check server console for error messages
4. Ensure `transporter` configuration is correct

❌ **If You Get Time Format Errors:**
- This has been fixed! The API now accepts both `"10:00 AM"` and `"10:00:00"` formats
- If you still see errors, make sure you're using the updated code
- Times are automatically converted for MySQL compatibility
